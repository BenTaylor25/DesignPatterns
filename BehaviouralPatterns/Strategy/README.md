# Strategy

The strategy pattern defines a
family of algorithms, each in
a separate class, and makes
their objects interchangeable.

---

The **State** and **Strategy** Patterns
are quite similar; both are based on
composition, and change the behaviour
of the context using helper object.  
Strategies are independent and unaware
of each other.  
States can be dependent as you can
jump between states.

The Strategy Pattern is used for different
implementation of the same idea.  
e.g. Sorting.

The State Pattern is used for doing
different things.
